# 🧠 SBD Flutter Template

The **SBD Flutter Template** is a lightweight Flutter frontend built **exclusively for the Second Brain Database (SBD)** backend.

It’s designed to be a fast starting point for creating apps that connect directly to the SBD — including tools for structured thought capture, metacognition, emotion tracking, and other second brain microframeworks.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- 🔐 Authentication-ready UI (Login, Signup, etc.)
- 🧱 Clean, modular, and minimal UI
- 🌙 Light/Dark mode support
- ⚡️ Quick to extend and plug into SBD backend

## 🎯 Purpose

This template serves as the **foundation** for any Flutter app that connects to the Second Brain Database — not a general-purpose starter. It’s the launchpad for my second brain tools and microframeworks.
